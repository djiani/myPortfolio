         As today, there is not a common online platform where you can find Cameroonian or African professors, except those who teach out of the continent. And therefore, it is more challenging to get in contact with most African professors with who to collaborate on projects, know who they are, and what they are working on. Cameroon Research Platform is a web platform design in the first place to share and promote Cameroonian professors but also, African professors and all university professors and researchers who would like to collaborate with other professors around the world or who would like to share their experience and professionalism. We encourage all Cameroonian professors, all African professors, or any professor to register to this app by sharing their cv, biography, and a summary of theirs research interest.
