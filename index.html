  <div class="bio_desc">
    <p>   Since a young age, creativity, innovation, and learning new technology has always been important to me; coding and problem solving are my passion. I love to challenge myself on innovative and interesting projects and it is always satisfying to see ideas come to life.

I consider myself to be very self-disciplined, optimistic, and detailed-oriented. I enjoy outdoors adventures, new discoveries, and sports events.</p>

         As of today, there is no common online platform where you can find Cameroonian or African professors, except those who teach outside of the continent. Therefore, it is very challenging to get in contact with most African professors, which makes it hard to collaborate on projects let alone know who they are and what they are working on. Cameroon Research Platform is a web platform designed to share and promote Cameroonian professors as well as African professors and all university professors and researchers who would like to collaborate with other professors and share their experience and professionalism. We encourage all professors -- regardless of where they're located -- to register on this app by sharing their cv, biography, and a summary of their research interest/topics.
